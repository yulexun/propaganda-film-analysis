Drawing on extensive archival research, Laura Pontieri reconstructs the dynamics inside Soviet animation studios and the relationships between the animators and the political establishment. Pontieri offers a meticulous study of Soviet animated films of the period, using the world of Soviet animation as a lens for viewing the historical moment of the thaw from a fresh and less conventional point of view},

  abstract = {La Guerre froide culturelle : recherche r{\'e}cente et perspectives {\`a} venir.             Cet article {\'e}tablit un bilan de l'historiographie de la Guerre froide culturelle. Il traite principalement de l'arme principale des Am{\'e}ricains, le <<Congress for Cultural Freedom>>, organisation apparemment ind{\'e}pendante de lib{\'e}raux, que soutenait en secret la CIA. L'article r{\'e}sume l'interpr{\'e}tation <<r{\'e}visionniste >> de la Guerre froide culturelle : il y a alors eu un complot efficace pour coloniser l'esprit des intellectuels. Puis il {\'e}voque l'interpr{\'e}tation <<post-r{\'e}visionniste >> plus r{\'e}cente, qui met l'accent sur la collaboration, l'appropriation et la r{\'e}sistance comme r{\'e}actions {\`a} la Guerre froide culturelle. En dernier lieu, l'article souligne le besoin d'une interpr{\'e}tation de la Guerre froide culturelle qui renouerait avec l'orientation critique du r{\'e}visionnisme tout en incorporant l'int{\'e}r{\^e}t des post-r{\'e}visionnistes pour la complexit{\'e} et la contingence, et signale quelques pistes de recherche ult{\'e}rieures.           ,              The Cultural Cold War : Recent Scholarship and Future Directions.             This paper is a survey of scholarship about the American effort in the ``Cultural Cold War'' (the contest between the United States and the Soviet Union for the ideological allegiance of the world's intellectuals after World War II). It is principally concerned with the US's main weapon, the Congress for Cultural Freedom, an ostensibly independent liberal organisation that was in fact covertly funded by the CIA. First, the paper summarises the ``revisionist'' interpretation of the Cultural Cold War which depicted a successful conspiracy to colonise the consciousness of the world's intellectuals. Second, the paper suggests that a ``post-revisionist'' interpretation has emerged which emphasises such responses to the American Cultural Cold War effort as collaboration, appropriation and resistance. Finally, the paper outlines an interpretative approach to the Cultural Cold War which recovers the critical orientation of the revisionists yet incorporates the post-revisionists' sensitivity to complexity and contingency. It ends with some suggestions for future research in the field.},
